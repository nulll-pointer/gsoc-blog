title: Work done in week 2, GSoC 2018 with phpmyadmin
---

### Week 2
Since my end sems are approaching fast and I've been really busy with college projects, It has been really difficult to give 6-7 hours everyday for GSoC.

I've implemented the login modal and submitted a PR for review.
Although, I've added comments at appropriate places to make the review and understanding easier. I'll be explaining the code in detail.

I'm also working on some issues in the issue tracker.
1. [getRealSize should expect also literals, not only integers](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/14307)
This issue seems to be a question which I am discussing in the issue page. 

2. 
[Query > Submit query : Error 500](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/14298)
