title: Google Summer of Code 2018 with phpmyadmin
---
Selected for GSoC 2018 :).

### Why phpmyadmin

I started backend development about a year ago and I've been using phpmyadmin ever since. I can't remember a time in my learning when I didn't use phpmyadmin to manage my databases. Using phpmyadmin makes the development process so easy and fast because I don't have to write SQL queries again and again, and can focus on writing code for my app.

I was determined to participate in GSoC this year and wanted to work in php to apply what I had learned and to take my development skills to a higher level. When I saw phpmyadmin as one of the organisations in GSoC, I had instantly decided that I'll be applying in this org.

### Early participation and contributions

I started contributing to phpmyadmin in January this year and I was fascinated to see the well-maintained multi-platform (Web, Desktop, Mobile) support and codebase.

Through my contributions in phpmyadmin I have learnt a lot about open source development and more importantly about good software development techniques. Following are the links to my contributions to the repository.

1. [Closed PRs](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anulll-pointer+is%3Aclosed).
2. [Open PRs](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anulll-pointer+is%3Aopen).
3. [Issues found](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Anulll-pointer+is%3Aclosed)

I am excited about contributing to phpmyadmin and hope to meet the expected standards.

### Project Abstract
The aim of the project is to implement [some of the enhancements](https://nulll-pointer.github.io/gsoc-blog/enhancements) suggested in the issue tracker to improve user experience(adding new useful features and making the app easier to use), security and performance.

### Blog and Checkins
I have still to figure out how often would I post on this blog. I am planning something of a weekly update posts but thatâ€™d depend on how the work progresses. 
I'll stay in contact with my mentor, reporting the progress, getting feedback about the ideas and the code I'll write.
