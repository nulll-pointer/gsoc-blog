title: Second enhancement, week 3, GSoC 2018 with phpmyadmin
---

### End of Week 3
I've submitted a PR for the second feature -
Following new features have been added to the csv import plugin- 

1. For a new import, user can now directly enter the table or database name at the time of import.
2. Partial import. User can enter how many rows they want to import.
3. Show table structure edit form when the import is successful(undecided).

I'm also working on some issues in the issue tracker.
1. (Issue in Changing theme)[https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/14295]
2. (preg_match error when clicking Insert or Search tabs)[https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/14315]
